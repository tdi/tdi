### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

My name is Darek ;) ğŸ’¬ Ask me about future of computing :) 

I am a generalist with skills in leadership, public cloud architectures, software development and CS research. I have done my fair share of entepreneurial work and angel investing. 

I love technology, feel best in "building" part of the shop, whether it is a company, code, architecture or infrastructure.
