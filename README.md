### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Darek ;) ðŸ’¬ Ask me about future of computing :) 

I am a generalist with skills in leadership, public cloud architectures, software development and CS research. 
I love technology, feel best in "building" part of the shop, whether it is a company, code, architecture or infrastructure. 

Currently serving as CEO of Bitropy.io, helping companies get the best outcomes from modern technology like AI, web3. 

My big strenghth and weakness is that I like a lot of things.
