### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

My name is Darek ;) ğŸ’¬ Ask me about future of computing :) 

I am a generalist with skills in leadership, public cloud architectures, software development and CS research. I have done my fair share of entepreneurial work and angel investing. 

I love technology, feel best in "building" part of the shop, whether it is a company, code, architecture or infrastructure. 



- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on wasm, pubic cloud, kubernetes related projects, especially with developer productivity in the scope
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: @darek on K8S slack or 7d1 in Twitter
